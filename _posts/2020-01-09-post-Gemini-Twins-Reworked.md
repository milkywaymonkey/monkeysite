# Effect
After having shuffled the deck a spectator is asked to pick out his favourite card out of a spread out deck, the performer then does the same.The performer then squares up the deck and starts dealing cards on the table. When he stops the spectator puts his favourite card face up on the pile of dealt cards and then the performer puts the remainder of the deck on top. Now the deck is handed to the spectator which does the same, i.e. starts dealing cards on the table. When he stops the performer puts his favourite card face up on the pile of dealt cards and then the spectator puts the remainder of the deck on top. The deck is then spread face down and the two favorite cards are facing their twins. {: .notice}


# Explanation

After having received the shuffled cards from the spectator the magician spreads the cards face up and asks the spectator to pick out his favourite card.

For this example let's pretend it's the ace of spades.While the spectator does this the performer looks for the twin of the favourite card (in this case the ace of clubs). The magician then selects his "favourite card" by selecting the twin of the card immediately to the right of the spectator's twin card. In this example it would be the two of hearts, which is directly to the right of the ace of clubs, thus the magician should choose the two of diamonds.

When the performer squares up the deck he cuts between the two twins of the favourite card, leaving the spectator's twin on the bottom and the performer's twin on the top.

Now the trick is self working.
When the magician starts dealing cards the first card he deals is the two of hearts (by the end of this phase will be the new bottom card).
When the magician stops dealing the spectator puts his card (the ace of spades) face up, by dropping the rest of the cards on top of it, the ace of clubs (which was on the bottom) naturally ends up next to it.
This procedure is now repeated with the deck in the spectator's control, it works the same because now the card on the bottom is the two of hearts.
